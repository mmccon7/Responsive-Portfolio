      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Matthew McConaghie">
      <p>I am an Arizona native of 20 plus years and enjoy living in the desert with my wife and 3 beautiful children.  I currently work as a Salesman / IT Support Rep at a building supply company and spend my days checking website sales, taking phone orders, and troubleshooting computer user issues.</p>
      <p>I became interested in coding and website creation shortly after graduating college when I discovered that I could easily create an online presence from popular website creation sites such as WIX or Squarespace.  For many of the website creation sites I couldnt achieve the exact look or structure that I was looking for.  I wanted to have the control to develop everything without having to use a theme or template.</p>
      <p>The University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp has given me the tools and knowledge to began a career transition into web development.  I am excited to break into this exciting career field and get coding!</p>
